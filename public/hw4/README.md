134B Final Report

PROBLEMS ENCOUNTERED:
HW1:
-HTML validation was a new concept to us, but it was good because it forced us to look-up and learn proper HTML.

HW2.1:
-Implementing the correct CSS to replicate the page. We didn't realize there were SO MANY different properties.

HW2.2:
-Getting our vanilla CSS page to look like our Bootstrap CSS page. Extracting the CSS we used from Bootstrap was tedious because Bootstrap is so large. In retrospect, it would've probably been more effective (time, performance, and readability) writing it from scratch.

HW3:
-Creating a pulldown menu combining JS with our "vanilla" CSS (vanilla in quotes because we adopted Bootstrap for the most part) was difficult. There were too many confusing custom class names and such--hence why we mentioned that it would've been easier if we wrote our CSS from scratch.
-We realized the difficulty of writing good & thorough code with the constraint of time.

HW4:
-Coding defensively is difficult because of the sheer number of things to account for and it requires you to really understand what's going on all areas (security measures put in place, browser, JS, network, etc.).


PERFORMANCE RESULTS:
-It was clear that once we were able to cut down on all the unnecessary css from Bootstrap css files, we were able to load our pages much faster as a result of the de-bloating.
-Another clear way where we were able to achieve better performance results was when we applied our app as a PWA. Saving all our content to the cache allowed us to reload our pages much faster when both online & offline.

Results: 
jQuery file from HW3 throttled to 3G: load time ~6!
Final/PWA version: load time ~ 133ms

TECH CHOICE & APPLICATION:
-It was just as time-consuming to learn Bootstrap (HW2.2) as it was to learn how to use Bootstrap (HW2.1) because there are so many properties in both. So, maybe using Bootstrap isn't that much easier or faster for the developer than it it's made out to be (and definitely to faster performance-wise).
-Learning jQuery was much easier after learning vanilla JS.
-PWAs are pretty fricking awesome--it was so cool to see our app work offline!


ITERATIVE APPROACH:
-The iterative approach streamlined the development of our soundboard and helped us better understand how everything works separately and together.
-Learning proper HTML and CSS made JS, jQuery, and manipulating the DOM much easier to do and understand.
-We saw, with each HW iteration, how much our soundboard improved in terms of coding efficiency and readability (which went hand-in-hand with performance) and UI/UX features.
